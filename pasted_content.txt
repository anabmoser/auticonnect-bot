Create a fully functional Telegram bot using the python-telegram-bot library (version 13 or above).
The bot is designed for people with autism and Therapeutic Aides (ATs), so it must be simple, predictable, and easy to understand.
Use Python 3 and structure the code in a clean and beginner-friendly way.

The bot should support the following commands:

/start: Start the conversation and register the user profile (store name, Telegram ID, and role: autistic or AT).

/grupos: List all available theme-based groups.

/atividades: Show upcoming structured activities for the user's group.

/criar_grupo (ATs only): Create a new thematic group.

/iniciar_atividade (ATs only): Start a structured activity in a group.

Technical requirements:

Code in Python 3, organized into simple files like main.py, db.py, etc.

Use MongoDB to store data, via the pymongo library.

Use environment variables like <BOT_TOKEN> and <MONGO_URI> in the code, not hardcoded secrets.

Create a requirements.txt with all needed packages.

Generate a Procfile for easy deployment on Railway (or optionally Replit).

Add simple and clear comments to explain what each part of the code does.

Important:

Do not include any dummy credentials or API keys.

Use <BOT_TOKEN> and <MONGO_URI> as placeholders only.

After generating the code, explain clearly (in English, for non-technical users) how to deploy this project to Railway or Replit without using a terminal or command line.
Use simple, step-by-step language that any beginner can follow.
